# ESP8266
Example of how to use an Arduino and the ESP8266 to send data to a web server

Change the SSID and the wifi password in the Setup and everything should work.  Of course
will be sending data to my Heroku server but thats cool.  Enjoy.

I am currently running the board off digital pins 8 and 9 but you can move that to any
pins you have available.  Comments or changes welcome.  I plan to modularize this a little
later for better reusability.
